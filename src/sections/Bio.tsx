      I previously worked as an SDE at Amazon, where I first started on the
      now-called Amazonian Experience &amp; Technology (AET) team building
      employee-facing HR tooling to make Amazon employees more autonomous in
      their HR procedures. I then joined Amazon S3&apos;s storage data plane
      team, working on S3&apos;s sharding and replication feature.

      The stack I currently work on is centered around Python with a Django
      monolith and FastAPI microservices, all talking to various PostgreSQL
      databases, alongside a Redis cache and a RabbitMQ mesage broker. At Amazon
      I worked more on Java technologies, and using AWS data stores such as S3
      and DynamoDB.
